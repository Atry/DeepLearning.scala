			<h2>A simple language for creating complex neural networks.</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			<strong>DeepLearning.scala</strong> is a domain-specific language embedded in <a href="http://scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>, for creating complex neural networks.
			With the help of DeepLearning.scala, regular programmers are able to build complex neural networks from simple code.
			You write code almost as usual. The only difference is that code based on DeepLearning.scala is <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/">differentiable</a>,
			able to evolve itself by modifying its parameters continuously.
